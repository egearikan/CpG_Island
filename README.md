# CpG_Island
 The CG island is a short stretch of DNA in which the frequency of the CG sequence is higher than other regions. It is also called the CpG island, where "p" simply indicates that "C" and "G" are connected by a phosphodiester bond.

Properties of CpG Islands
• Between 50-60% of all genes have a CpG island in its promoter regions
• Almost all house keeping genes have a CpG island
• CpG islands are usually hypomethylated but aberrant methylation of these
  regions plays an important role in epigenetic formation of many cancer types.
• CpG islands are important “attributes” in the in silico detection of promoters and
  to predict methylation probabilities
